fancy vim plugin to make your cpp code Awesome with vim conceal

The vim-cute-cpp is a vim-plugin to make your cpp's code more fancy. It's based on the vim's new feature --conceal. It can replace your code with some unicode if the rule is matched.  This tool is inspired by vim-cute-javascript.

# Install

Just put the cpp.vim into your ~/.vim/after/syntax dir and everything should be ok.
